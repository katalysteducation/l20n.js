# EntriesParser

The `Parser` class is responsible for parsing FTL resources.

It's only public method is `getResource(source)` which takes an FTL
string and returns a two element Array with an Object of entries
generated from the source as the first element and an array of L10nError
objects as the second.

This parser is optimized for runtime performance.

There is an equivalent of this parser in ftl/ast/parser which is
generating full AST which is useful for FTL tools.

## getResource

**Parameters**

-   `string` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)**
